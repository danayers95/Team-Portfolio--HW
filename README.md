## Description
An application which generates an HTML page consisting of a team of workers consisting of Interns, Managers, and Engineers. 

## Installation

* Clone this repository
* Enter npm i so that inquirer is installed.
* launch node app.js and answer all prompts
* team.html will be generated, displaying all information in one place.

## Instructions

Just run 'node app.js' after 'npm i' has been run, which will bring up a list of prompts regarding the employee's name, email, and id number. The user will then be provided with a rawlist that will ask if they are entering an Intern, Manager or Engineer. This answer will give the application info on which question to provide them with next. If engineer, the user will be asked for a github name. If manager, they will be asked for an office number. If intern, they will be asked about what school they're going to. The user will then be asked if they would like to enter another team member, otherwise it will generate an html page in the 'output' folder that will display a localized web page with the information on it.

## Tests

When setting up the javascript files in the lib folder, I had to run tests in my command line frequently to make sure things were running smoothly. No automated tests were written for this application.
